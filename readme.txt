Final Project – My Next Book 

Overview: 
My Next Book is a web application designed to provide book recommendations based on books the user already love and to provide a comfortable platform to connect with other book lovers. The problem it solves is the constant search for finding books the user is going to love, making it easier to find a great next reading. This project is motivated by my own experiences with narrowing options on the large list of existing books and finding one that I would like.
Target Audience: 
This application is targeted at anyone who enjoys reading and enjoys connecting with fellow readers. It will be useful for:
•	Current avid readers.
•	New readers that are not sure of how to choose their readings.
•	People interested in books.

Major Functions: 
1.	Book searcher: users can enter the name of a book and will be redirected to the information page, where they can find info about the book and recommendations based on that book.
2.	User account creation: users can log in and save their favorite books (info is save in localStorage).
3.	Books genres search: users can choose a book genre and explore the options to choose their next reading.
4.	Books lists: the users can create a list of favorites.
5.	Quotes generator: it generates a random quote when the page is loaded.
6.	Blind Date Book Feature: for those who can’t know where to begin their reading journey, this button will randomly select a book.
7.	Responsive Design: the application will be full responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
8.	CSS animations: include animations for section transitions, and interactive elements (hover effects on buttons and links).
